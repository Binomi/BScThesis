	abstract = {Two distinct regimes of stable multiple pulse operation of a self mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser with pulse separations between 100 fs and 1 ps, and in the nanosecond range are observed. The second lasing mode distinguishes itself by colliding pulses in the Ti:sapphire crystal and its occurrence can be explained by a nonlinear interaction of the two pulses at their crossing point.},
